Computer networks


# Computer networks
<p>Lab Projects for ECE361  Computer networks at U of T, You can use my code as reference but please do not plagiarize.
Through this course, I was able to grasp the lower level intricacies of computer networks.</p>
<p>Topics and labs may include:</p>
<p>Five layers of the computer networks and corresponding protocals:</p><ul>
<li>Layer 5: Application Layer  (HTTP , FTP)</li>
<li>Layer 4: Transport Layer (TCP - reliable data transfer   UDP -unreliable data transfer)</li>
<li>Layer 3: Network Layer (IP, OSPF, RIP)</li>
<li>Layer 2: Data Link Layer</li>
<li>Layer 1: Phisical Layer</li>
**Authors**: Ye Yuan</li>
</ul>

**Technologies Used:** Java</b>

**Labs Include:**
  - **Lab 1** Java warm up, practice of socket programming. Implemented a basic echo server
  - **Lab 2** FTP server design. Use different thread for sending/receiving the packets to implement full duplex. Also, data and control information are sent through different TCP connections.
  - **Lab 3** ARQ. Used two approach to implement reliable data transfer: stop and wait, go back n
  - **Lab 4** TCP. Further more, implemented TCP protocal using socket interface. To realize reliable data transfer, used selective repeat. To accomplish congestion control, used TCP Reno and Taheo, seprately.
  - **Lab 5** Rounting. Took use of Dijkstra's algorithm to calculate the optimal path between two nodes in the network.(link state).
  - **Lab 6** Project: Everything.
